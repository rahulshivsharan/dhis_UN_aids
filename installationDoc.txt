Note : There is an issue.
When we do "gulp build", all user created scripts are merged and compressed to "app-someRandomString.js" and all the js libraries are merged and compressed to
"vendor-someRandomString.js", these generated scripts gets referred in index.html on the fly. Sometimes "gulp build" command generates multiple scripts
and out of which only few gets referred in index.html, hence the build version of our application fails when build is deployed on server.
Hence to avoid this, after doing "gulp build" please refer that all the scripts are getting referred in index.html, if not, include those manually.
